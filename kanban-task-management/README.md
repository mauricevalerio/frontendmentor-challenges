## Overview

### The challenge

Your users should be able to:

- [x] View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- [ ] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [x] Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- [x] Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- [x] Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- [x] Hide/show the board sidebar
- [x] Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- [x] Bonus: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
- [x] Bonus: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (localStorage could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
- [ ] Bonus: Build this project as a full-stack application

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)

### What I learned
- Learned the basics of Redux toolkit and use it with React Redux.
- Lesson learned not to use 2 CSS frameworks as the styles conflicts with each other specifically tailwind CSS and React Bootstrap and have to resort to monkey patching it by putting !important when a style needs to be implemented.

### Continued development
Deploy as a full stack web application.
